# Dog Classifier

This project is a Jupyter Notebook that implements a machine learning model to classify dog images by breed. The classifier leverages deep learning techniques to identify different dog breeds based on input images.

## Features

- **Image Preprocessing**: Converts images into a suitable format for model training.
- **Model Architecture**: Utilizes a deep neural network to classify dog breeds accurately.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Displays model accuracy and other performance metrics to assess the classifierâ€™s effectiveness.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - TensorFlow or PyTorch
  - OpenCV
  - Numpy
  - Matplotlib
  - Scikit-learn

You can install all dependencies with:
```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Load the Notebook: Open Dog_classifier.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run All Cells: Execute each cell sequentially to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
3. Prediction: Use the final cells to input new images and classify the dog breed.
